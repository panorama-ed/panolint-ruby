## Usage

### `rubocop`

You can use `panolint-ruby`'s rubocop configuration in your project with the following addition to the top of your project's `.rubocop.yml`:

```
inherit_gem:
  panolint-ruby: panolint-ruby-rubocop.yml
```

Note that it for this gem in particular in needs to not be a `.rubocop.yml` file because of rubocop's [path relativity](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/configuration.md#path-relativity).
